# SwiftUI App with SafariViewController & Deep Linking

Showcasing an iOS application built with **SwiftUI** that:
- Opens a **SafariViewController** when a "Subscribe" button is tapped.
- Loads a simple **subscription confirmation webpage** that includes a **"Complete" button**. When clicked, it **redirects users back to the mobile app** using a deep link (`myapp://subscriptionComplete`).
- Uses **deep linking** to return to the app after subscription.
